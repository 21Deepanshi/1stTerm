    <h1><font face="Verdana">Last Match and Retirement</font></h1>
    <p><font face="Helvetica"> Dhoni's final appearance in an India jersey was characterized by his signature calm and composed demeanor, despite the high stakes of the World Cup. 
        Unfortunately, India fell short in their chase, losing to New Zealand by 18 runs and ending their campaign. Dhoni, known for his exceptional finishing skills, scored 50 runs before being run out, leaving the Indian fans heartbroken and plaintive.
        On <b>August 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020</b>, Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket via an emotional post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CD6ZQn1lGBi/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
        In his message, he expressed gratitude to his fans and supporters, stating, <q>Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout. From 1929 hrs consider me as Retired.</q> This announcement marked the end of Dhoni's 16-year career in international cricket.(Wikipedia, 2024)
